Conclusion Report — TikTok Logistic Regression Project

In this project, we explored a dataset of TikTok videos and users with the goal of predicting whether an account is verified. 
Our workflow included exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model building, and interpretation of results.

Key Findings:
- Severe skewness in engagement metrics (views, likes, shares, downloads, comments) required log transformation.
- Strong multicollinearity was observed between views and likes (correlation ~0.86), leading to the exclusion of video_like_count.
- Verified accounts show distinct engagement patterns compared to non-verified accounts.
- Class imbalance was significant (≈94% not verified, 6% verified) and addressed using class weights or oversampling.

Business Insights:
- Verified users are more likely to post opinions, which are less critical for fact-checking than claims but reach larger audiences.
- Prioritizing moderation of content from verified accounts can help reduce backlog and ensure more impactful content is reviewed first.
- Engagement metrics can serve as strong signals for distinguishing verified accounts.

Future Work:
- Extend the model to directly classify claim vs opinion.
- Incorporate NLP on video transcripts for deeper linguistic analysis.
- Experiment with advanced models (ensemble methods, transformers) for improved performance.

This project demonstrates how data science and machine learning can support content moderation strategies on social media platforms, 
making moderation more efficient, scalable, and transparent.
